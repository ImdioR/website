  faqs:
    - q: Asset Originator
      a: Companies that provide advance financing to multiple businesses. Asset Originators get financed via lenders in Tinlake Pools. 
    - q: RWA
      a: Real-World Assets; these are non native crypto assets, such as invoices or music streaming royalties.
    - q: SPV
      a: Special Purpose Vehicle - a legal entity created to fulfill narrow, specific or temporary objectives. Typically used by companies to isolate the firm from financial risk. In Centrifuge, SPVs enforce that legal recourse is available to holders of DROP and TIN.
    - q: DROP & TIN
      a: md// Based on each NFT pool, ERC20 tokens (TIN and DROP) are minted. These two tokens represent the underlying collateral. DROP is the Senior token with a fixed interest rate and stable returns, loss protected by TIN. TIN is the Junior token with higher yield and risk; takes loss first. You can read more [here](https://developer.centrifuge.io/tinlake/overview/tranches/).
    - q: NFT
      a: md// **Non-Fungible Token** as a digital representation of a single unique collateral, IE one invoice. The Centrifuge business NFT follows the [ERC-/EIP-721 Ethereum standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721).
    - q: Revolving Pool
      a: A pool that funds assets continuously; a revolving pool grows/shrinks depending on the balance of investor interest and assets which need to be financed.

  faqs:
    - q: Pool Value
      a: "Total pool value calculated as: sum of Asset Value and Pool Reserve."
    - q: Asset Value
      a: The Asset Value (NAV) reflects the present value of the outstanding portfolio of financings. It is the sum of the present values of the risk-adjusted expected repayments of all outstanding financings.
    - q: Pool Reserve
      a: Amount of currency currently held in the pool that is not currently deployed for financings by the Asset Originator. The reserve is available for financing by the Asset Originator and redemptions by investors.
    - q: DROP APR
      a: Annual interest rate (APR) at which the DROP Token accrues interest applied on outstanding financings (compounded secondly).
    - q: TIN Risk Buffer
      a: Amount of TIN in relation to the Pool Value. The Minimum TIN Risk Buffer indicates the lower limit and ensures that DROP investors are protected by a certain amount of TIN invested in the pool at any time.
    - q: Outstanding Volume
      a: Sum of the debt on all financings in the pool. This deviates from the Asset Value which considers expected repayments and risk-adjustments.
    - q: DROP Value
      a: Total value of outstanding DROP tokens at the current DROP token price.
    - q: TIN Value
      a: Total value of outstanding TIN tokens at the current TIN token price.
    - q: "Epoch #"
      a: Invest and redeem transactions are locked over a defined period of time ("Epoch") and automatically executed at best effort at the end of this period, adhering to the pools predetermined risk limits such as the Minimum TIN Risk Buffer.
    - q: Minimum Epoch Duration
      a: Minimum time of an epoch for this pool during which invest and redeem orders can be locked. At the end of the epoch the locked orders will be executed by the smart contracts. An epoch can also take longer, if no outstanding orders are locked.
    - q: Total Epoch Investment Capacity
      a: The investment capacity indicates how much investors can invest before the pool is oversubscribed. It is calculated as the difference between the maximum reserve allowed for this pool and currently locked invest and redeem orders.
    - q: Available for Financing
      a: The value of the underlying collateral determines how much an Asset Originator can finance against a locked NFT. An Asset Originator may choose to finance less than the available amount.
    - q: Risk Group
      a: The risk group of a financing determines the interest rate based on the underlying scorecard.
    - q: Maturity Date
      a: Expected repayment date for the outstanding financing. It is used to calculate the present value of the financing for the pool's asset value.
    - q: Financing Fee
      a: Annual interest rate (APR) at which the interest for the outstanding financing is accrued with secondly compounding.

- title: Investing in Tinlake
  faqs:
    - q: Do I need to KYC/AML for every Tinlake pool I want to invest in?
      a: Currently all our asset originators and their asset issuers are using Securitize.io as a shared KYC/AML platform. This means you can reuse your KYC/AMLed Securitize iD for all our asset originator’s/issuer’s offerings.
    - q: When I invest in DROP, does my balance of DROP change or does the exchange rate for Dai change as my investment accrues principal and interest?
      a: Your balance of DROP tokens remains constant. The price of these tokens (and thus the amount of Dai that you can redeem for your DROP) increases as your investment accrues interest.
    - q: Can I transfer my DROP token?
      a: Technically DROP tokens can be transferred similar to other ERC20 tokens. However, due to their security status, their transfer is restricted to other whitelisted addresses only. If you want to transfer your DROP to another one of your addresses, please get in touch to get it whitelisted.
    - q: Can you explain Centrifuge’s token structure? I see RAD, TIN and DROP. Why are there three tokens?
      a: md// The RAD token powers Centrifuge Chain and Protocol. TIN and DROP are used in Tinlake, a dApp running on Centrifuge. Please find more information on our RAD token [here](https://centrifuge.io/products/chain/) and on Tinlake’s TIN and DROP [here](https://developer.centrifuge.io/tinlake/overview/tranches/).
    - q: Is TIN available for investors?
      a: Our Asset Originators have only opened TIN to a small number of institutional investors who have been instrumental in developing their product. We anticipate that in the future some Asset Originators will choose to make TIN more widely available to investors.

- title: Originating Assets through Tinlake
  faqs:
    - q: What kind of collateral do you support?
      a: Centrifuge tokenizes any type of business document and converts it to a non-fungible token (NFT). Most Asset Originators use Centrifuge to tokenize payment obligations like loans, invoices, warehouse receipts, payment orders, etc. However, hard assets and commodities can also be tokenized with the Centrifuge blockchain. 
    - q: How do I repay my debt?
      a: The Tinlake Protocol allows the Asset Originator to lock in collateral NFTs and finance an asset in with a stablecoin, such as Dai. This can be given to the borrowers or converted to fiat and then provided to borrowers. Upon repayment from the borrower, the Asset Originator converts the repayment back to the stablecoin and repays principal and interest to the protocol. Once Tinlake is fully repaid, the protocol will unlock the collateral NFT making it available for withdrawal by the Asset Originator.

- title: Using Centrifuge Chain
  faqs:
    - q: Who is responsible for the custody of the real world asset which is the underlying asset of the NFT token. If the real world asset got sold, how can we legally enforce that it will be notified?
      a: Let’s say the Asset Originator (AO) is a mortgage originator. We have Alice, who uses her house as collateral for a mortgage through this AO. Legally, Alice enters into a payment obligation with the AO. This is a contract. The AO can hold this payment obligation in their own Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) and they have standard legal recourse against the borrower as defined in the payment obligation. The AO then uses Centrifuge to mint an NFT of the payment obligation. The NFT is also owned by the SPV. The SPV locks the NFT into Tinlake and finances the mortgage. What happens if Alice wants to sell her house? With the mortgage, the AO takes title to the house until the mortgage is fully paid off. If Alice were to sell her house, she would need to pay off her mortgage in order to take ownership of her title. The SPV would receive a cash payment from Alice and the SPV would payback the financing from Tinlake in order to unlock the NFT, which is returned to the SPV and burned as the title is transferred back to Alice. If Alice were to sell her house, she would need to pay off her mortgage in order to take ownership of her title. The SPV would receive a cash payment from Alice and the SPV would payback the loan from Tinlake in order to unlock the NFT, which is returned to the SPV and burned as the Title is transferred back to Alice.

- title: Risk Assessment
  faqs:
    - q: Who verifies for the asset before the NFT is issued? 
      a: For Tinlake the risk assessment happens based on the NFT before it is locked as collateral into Tinlake. There will be a provenance oracle which verifies the claim upon the underlying collateral. Then, the risk assessment will be conducted by the underwriter, e.g. valuation firms and pushed on-chain through a pricing oracle. In the future we envisage this process to be decentralized as well. We have to work together with the asset originators to build an underwriting process that the lenders are comfortable with.
    - q: What is the collateralization level on the NFT portfolio relative to the loan amount? 
      a: That depends on the asset class, e.g. if you buy a home in the US you can get as low as 10% of down payment, sometimes 20%. That eventually translates down to the collateralization rate. For supply chain finance with invoices as an asset you usually have a 80% advance rate as industry standard, sometimes up to 100%. That would be the collateralization ratio for invoice NFTs. One important part to keep in mind, the Tinlake smart contracts are intended to be deployed for each individual asset class with specific parameters.
    - q: How is a pool priced? Both at an initial issuance and later during the pool's life? 
      a: md// There is no generic answer to what a pricing oracle looks like in particular. We built Tinlake with both crypto native and real-world assets in mind; these assets are priced very differently. For example, a house is priced very differently from an invoice, which is priced very differently from ETH. When setting up the pool, the Asset Originator who wants to create the pool will work with data sources that exist today, such as underwriters, risk modelers, fraud prevention companies in order to build the safest oracle for that pool. You can read more about pricing real-world assets [here.] (https://developer.centrifuge.io/tinlake/overview/pricing_rwa/)
